Title : An introduction to categorical data modeling  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
This talk will give an informal and accessible introduction to the use of category theory for modeling logical (or ontological) information. Topics will include the relationship between categories and graphs, logical structures in a category and functorial semantics. If time allows, I will also say a bit about how these approaches generalize to other structures like monoidal categories and operads.

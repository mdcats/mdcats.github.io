### Upcoming Meetings





Speaker : Steve Huntsman  
Date : April 23 @ 2pm  
Title: Categorical imperatives for designing data structures, algorithms, and system architectures  
<br/>

Speaker : James Fairbanks  
Date : April 30 @ 2pm  
<br/>

Speaker : Noson Yanofksy  
Date : May 7 @ 2pm  
Title : Theoretical Computer Science for the Working Category Theorist  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
This talk is a preview of a forthcoming book in the Applied Category Theory series of Cambridge University Press. The book uses basic category theory to describe all the central concepts and prove the main theorems of theoretical computer science. Category theory, which works with functions, processes, and structures, is uniquely qualified to present the fundamental results of theoretical computer science. We will meet some of the deepest ideas and theorems of modern computers and mathematics,  e.g., Turing machines, unsolvable problems, the P=NP question, Kurt GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem, intractable problems, cryptographic protocols, Alan Turing's Halting problem, and much more. I will report on new things I learned about theoretical computer science and category theory while working on this project.

### Past Meetings

Speaker : Saul Hilsenrath  
Date : April 16 @ 2pm  
Location : Zoom 915-7667-7156  
Title : Infinity Toposes and Integrable Physical Systems \[[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNWXUAPpJWc)\] \[[refs](..\assets\docs\Saul_References_April_16.pdf)\]
<br/>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
 In physics, wave phenomena are modeled by integrable systems of PDEs, the solutions of which are points in an infinite-dimensional Grassmannian. In this talk, I will show that the Grassmannian and certain other physically-relevant moduli spaces, time permitting, correspond to instances of a particular class of infinity toposes. I will conclude with some of the mathematical and physical implications.

Speaker : Noah Chrein  
Date : April 9, 2020  
Title : Reasoning with Hierarchical Ontologies  \[[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CPAJn49oQk)\]  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
I will give an intuitive introduction to representation and reasoning with hierarchical ontologies. Most of the talk will be done through a notes application, but I will also show a prototype graphical interface for creating ontologies.

Speaker : Mike Rawson  
Date : March 26, 2020  
Title : Categorification of Persistent Homology \[[notes](../assets/docs/Mike_Rawson_March_26.pdf)\]  
<br/>

Speaker : Spencer Breiner  
Date : February 27, 2020  
Title : An introduction to categorical data modeling  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>
This talk will give an informal and accessible introduction to the use of category theory for modeling logical (or ontological) information. Topics will include the relationship between categories and graphs, logical structures in a category and functorial semantics. If time allows, I will also say a bit about how these approaches generalize to other structures like monoidal categories and operads.
